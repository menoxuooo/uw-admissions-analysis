Analyzing Factors Influencing University of Washington Admissions and Outcomes (2019–2023)
## 📘 Project Summary
This project investigates trends in University of Washington (UW) undergraduate admissions from 2019 to 2023.  
Our analysis finds that UW has become increasingly selective — with admission rates dropping by roughly 9 percentage points — yet yield rates remained stable. This suggests growing applicant interest despite rising competitiveness. The elimination of standardized testing requirements (SAT/ACT) after 2021 also reshaped admission patterns, placing more emphasis on holistic criteria such as GPA, essays, and personal background.

Gender patterns were particularly notable: female applicants consistently outnumbered and outperformed male applicants, and this gap has widened over time. These findings reflect both institutional shifts and broader societal trends in higher education.

## 🎯 Research Questions
1. **How has UW’s admission rate changed from 2019 to 2023, and what factors might explain this trend?**  
   *UW’s admission rate declined from ~52% to ~43%, driven by test-optional policies and increased application volumes.*

2. **How do gender patterns in UW admissions compare over time?**  
   *Female applicants and enrollees increased more rapidly than males, aligning with national higher-education trends.*

3. **How have SAT/ACT scores related to admission outcomes, and how has this changed?**  
   *Before 2021, higher scores correlated with admission success; after test-optional adoption, this effect declined sharply.*

## 🧩 Data and Methods
- **Dataset:** UW admissions data (IPEDS CDS datasets, 2019–2023)
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `altair`
- **Methods:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualizing admission and enrollment trends.
  - Statistical Modeling: logistic regression and subgroup comparisons by gender and residency.
  - Automated testing for reproducibility and data consistency.

---

## 📈 Key Results
- UW’s admission rate declined while yield remained steady, indicating sustained demand.
- Women consistently had higher admission and enrollment rates than men.
- SAT/ACT scores became weaker predictors of admission after the test-optional policy.

## 🧠 Challenge Goals
Extended the base project by:
- Creating gender comparison plots for applicants, admits, and enrollees.
- Building a SAT/ACT vs. admission rate visualization.
- Automating data verification across multiple years.
